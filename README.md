# mc202-2020
Collection of assignments and exercises from the MC202 course (Data Structures and Algorithms) taken in 2020.   These codes were written while I was learning C, so expect a mix of experiments, messy logic, and chaotic organization.   Mostly focused on implementing classic data structures and algorithmic concepts.
